			<h2>About Me</h2>
			
			<p>
				Hello there! My name is Chantal Snazel. I am designer and computer programmer, with interests in video game design, augmented reality, 3D printing and web design. In my spare time, I take up hobbies like sewing and roller derby. My favorite projects are where I get to utilize my knowledge and skills from different disciplines and hobbies.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am currently an undergraduate student at Simon Fraser University, studying Interactive Arts and Design. This program allows me to explore design in many contexts, and it gives me the experience to be prepared for anything that comes my way.
