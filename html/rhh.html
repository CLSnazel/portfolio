						The Mothers Matter Centre (MMC) is a national, virtual consortium of organizations that empowers children and
						families by supporting and educating mothers with the HIPPY program  (Home Instruction for Parents of Preschool Youngsters).
						This program employs mothers from socially-isolated and low income communities,
						training them as home visitors who come to the home of mothers in their community to deliver short activities to do with
						their preschool-aged child throughout the week. This prepares children for kindergarten and get mothers involved with their child’s education

						As part of their research, MMC found that refugee mothers were more intensely isolated, and heavily relied on their Home Visitors,
						often requiring extra help to access resources and translate curriculum. Refugee clients also had more urgent issues to handle than
						their child’s education, including housing, employment, and PTSD. This brought the development of Reviving Hope and Home (RHH), a program designed
						for Government Assisted Refugees using core HIPPY elements in order to make settlement a smoother process.

			<h3>The Problem</h3>
			<p>
				I suggested that RHH have its own app, since a key issue before RHH was
				HIPPY Staff were being asked by clients for the same resources and
				information over and over again, each time going through a time-consuming
				chain of people before a referral is given to a client. By centralizing
				this information in an app, RHH staff can easily reference the app when
				a client needs information. Creating an app also separates the referrals
				from the learning and extension activities we would include on the LearnCloud.

			<h3>Design and Programming Decisions</h3>
			<p>
				Since Rumie Tablets run on Android, the project was started using Android Studio. However, the committee thought it would ideal to make an app that
				would be available for both Android and iOS. Searching online brought me to React Native and Expo. React Native is a mobile derivative of React,
				a javascript library developed by Facebook for creating UI components for websites. React Native is currently being used for Facebook, Pinterest,
				Uber and more. This is paired with Expo, a framework for React Native, giving developers the ability to code for both Android and iOS with the
				same Javascript code. It also provides tools to get projects up and running quickly, such as navigators, UI elements, and more. This was key
				as I was new to Javascript and React Native at the start of this project.

						The backend of the application uses Google Drive API, particularly for Google Sheets and Google Docs. Using Google Sheets and Docs
					 allows for RHH staff who are not skilled in computer programming or databases to be able to manipulate the app should anything need changing.

					<p>
						Since resources and information may expand or change over time, the
						application needed to be able to handle content dynamically. And with
						some essential needs requiring more than one resource, the app needed
						to support sheets linked to sheets, creating folders of resources.
						To do this, the app uses recursive functions to update and manage its data.

			<h3>Challenges</h3>
			<p>
				Being new to mobile development, Javascript and React Native challenged
				my ability to learn quickly and troubleshoot code. Due to these tools being
				relatively new, finding solutions for errors was often difficult. Searching
				online was sometimes fruitless, leading myself to consult forums. Without
				any responses, I turned to attending React Developer Meetups to learn more
				from presentations and speak to peers for help. Additionally,  I reached out
				to a trusted professor from SFU for support. Overall I was on the right track
				with finding solutions online, it was just a matter of finding the right search
				terms and the digging for the right webpages. Ultimately asking for help gave
				me a chance to reflect on my issue and I was able to solve them on my own.

			<h3>Focus Group and Results</h3>
			<p>
				As part of the co-op position, one learning objective was to lead a focus group to
				get feedback from RHH Home Visitors about the app. I was pleased to see Home Visitors
				being able to access the app and their eagerness to provide their thoughts and opinions.
				With their suggestions for improvements I am now able to finalize the app as the work
				term comes to an end.

			<h3>Learning Reflection</h3>
			<p>
				Through my time at Mothers Matter Centre I was able to learn and explore app
				development in a professional environment. Building an application on my own
				gave me a challenge with my computer programming and problem solving skills.
			 	After this project, I am confident that I can figure out how to code anything.
				I am thankful for this opportunity with Mother Matter Centre, and I am happy
				knowing that the work I do directly helps RHH staff and to assist them in
				improving the lives of their clients.
