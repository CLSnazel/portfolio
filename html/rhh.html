						The Mothers Matter Centre (MMC) is a national, virtual consortium of
						 organizations that empowers children and families by supporting and
						 educating mothers with the HIPPY program  (Home Instruction for
						 Parents of Preschool Youngsters). This program employs mothers from
						 socially-isolated and low income communities, training them as home
						 visitors who come to the home of mothers in their community to deliver
						 short activities to do with their preschool-aged child throughout the
						 week. This prepares children for kindergarten and gets mothers involved
						 with their child’s education.

						As part of their research, MMC found that refugee mothers were more
						intensely isolated, and heavily relied on their Home Visitors, often
						requiring extra help to access resources and translate curriculum.
						Refugee mothers also had more urgent issues to handle than their
						child’s education, including housing, employment, and mental health
						challenges related to stress and trauma. This brought the development
						of Reviving Hope and Home (RHH), a program designed for Government
						Assisted Refugees using core HIPPY elements in order to make settlement
						a smoother process.

			<h3>Mobile App Reasoning</h3>
			<p>
				I suggested that RHH have its own app, since a key issue before RHH was
				HIPPY Home Visitors and Coordinators were being asked by mothers for the
				same resources and information over and over again, each time going through
				a time-consuming chain of people before a referral is given to the mother.
				By centralizing this information in an app, RHH staff can easily reference
				the app when a mother needs information. Creating an app also separates
				the referrals from the learning and extension activities we would include
				on the LearnCloud.

			<h3>Design and Programming Decisions</h3>
			<p>
				Since Rumie Tablets run on Android, the project was started using Android Studio. However, the committee thought it would ideal to make an app that
				would be available for both Android and iOS. Searching online brought me to React Native and Expo. React Native is a mobile derivative of React,
				a javascript library developed by Facebook for creating UI components for websites. React Native is currently being used for Facebook, Pinterest,
				Uber and more. This is paired with Expo, a framework for React Native, giving developers the ability to code for both Android and iOS with the
				same Javascript code. It also provides tools to get projects up and running quickly, such as navigators, UI elements, and more. This was key
				as I was new to Javascript and React Native at the start of this project.
			</p>
			<div class="half-col">
				<div class="left">
					<p>
						The backend of the application uses Google Drive API, particularly for
						Google Sheets and Google Docs. Using these tools allows for RHH staff
						who are not skilled in computer programming or databases to be able
						to manipulate the app should anything need changing.
					</p>

					<figcaption> The app needed to accomodate resources grouped together in several layers of spreadsheets, as shown in this diagram.</figcaption>
				</figure>
			</div>

			<div class="half-col">
				<div class="left">
					<p>
						Since resources and information may expand or change over time, the
						application needed to be able to handle content dynamically. And with
						some essential needs requiring more than one resource, the app needed
						to support sheets linked to sheets, creating folders of resources.
						To do this, the app uses recursive functions to update and manage its data.
					</p>

						as well as a translation in Arabic and Farsi to help clients who may have difficulties

			<h3>Challenges</h3>
			<p>
				Being new to mobile development, Javascript and React Native challenged
				my ability to learn quickly and troubleshoot code. Due to these tools being
				relatively new, finding solutions for errors was often difficult. Searching
				online was sometimes fruitless, leading myself to consult forums. Without
				any responses, I turned to attending React Developer Meetups to learn more
				from presentations and speak to peers for help. Additionally,  I reached out
				to a trusted professor from SFU for support. Overall I was on the right track
				with finding solutions online, it was just a matter of finding the right search
				terms and the digging for the right webpages. Ultimately asking for help gave
				me a chance to reflect on my issue and I was able to solve them on my own.

			<h3>Focus Group and Results</h3>
			<div class="half-col">
				<div class="left">
					<p>
						As part of the co-op position, one learning objective was to lead a focus
						group to get feedback from RHH Home Visitors about the app. While I had
						completed user research and testing in other projects, it was important
						for me to have experience in a professional environment. To ensure I was
						prepared for the focus group, I reviewed past assignments and readings
						from my courses. I also prepared an activity to help Home Visitors familiarize
						themselves with the app and practice using it. However, I was pleased to
						find Home Visitors coming prepared with questions and eager to provide feedback.
						I was able to run the focus group dynamically, with no need to use the activity,
						giving the group more time to give comments. With their suggestions for
						improvements I am now able to finalize the app as the work term comes to an end.

			<h3>Learning Reflection</h3>
			<p>
				Through my time at Mothers Matter Centre I was able to learn and explore
				app development in a professional environment. Building an application on
				my own gave me a challenge with my computer programming and problem solving
				skills. After this project, I am confident that I can figure out how to code
				anything. I am thankful for this opportunity with Mother Matter Centre. It
				is gratifying to know that my work directly assists RHH staff in improving
				the lives of RHH mothers
