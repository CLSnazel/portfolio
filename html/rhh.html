						The <a href="https://www.mothersmattercentre.ca/">Mothers Matter Centre</a>
						(MMC) is a national, virtual consortium of
						organizations that empowers children and families by supporting and
						educating mothers with the HIPPY program  (Home Instruction for
						Parents of Preschool Youngsters). This program employs mothers from
						socially-isolated and low income communities, training them as home
						visitors who come to the home of mothers in their community to deliver
						short activities to do with their preschool-aged child throughout the
						week. This prepares children for kindergarten and gets mothers
						involved with their child’s education.

						As part of their research, MMC found that refugee mothers were more
						intensely isolated, and heavily relied on their Home Visitors, often
						requiring extra help to access resources and translate curriculum.
						Refugee mothers also had more urgent issues to handle including housing,
						employment, and mental health challenges related to stress and trauma.
						This brought the development of Reviving Hope and Home (RHH), a
						program designed for Government Assisted Refugees using core HIPPY
						elements in order to make settlement a smoother process.

						RHH was funded by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada and

						The Rumie Initiative is an organization that gives underserved communities
						access to education through Rumie Tablets and LearnCloud. Rumie tablets
						are used by mothers and Home Visitors to access the information and
						resources they need.

			<h3>RHH App</h3>
			<p>
				I suggested that RHH have its own app, since a key issue before RHH was
				HIPPY Home Visitors and Coordinators were being asked by mothers for the
				same resources and information over and over again, each time going
				through a time-consuming chain of people before a referral is given
				to the mother. By centralizing this information in an app, RHH staff
				can easily reference the app when a mother needs information. Creating
				an app also separates the referrals from the learning and extension
				activities we would include on the LearnCloud.

			<h3>Mobile App</h3>
			<p>
				I began development with React Native and Expo, since Rumie tablets
				would be used in the program and mobile devices were more common than
				others for our target audience. Using React Native with Expo would allow
				me to develop for both iOS and Android simultaneously. This came with
				great challenges as React Native and Expo are both relatively new tools,
				making it difficult to learn and develop independently. Running into errors
				often lead to long and sometimes fruitless searches for solutions.
				I diligently reached out for assistance on forums online and from
				university instructors, and went to developer meetups in the area.

			</p>
			<div class="half-col">
				<div class="left">
					<p>
						To retrieve service information dynamically, the app accesses Google
						Drive and Google Sheets as the resource data may change over time.
						Google Sheets structures the categories of resources and which pages
						appear in them, and Google Docs provides resource information as an
						offline page for later. While unconventional, using the Google Drive
						platform provided a way for services partners to make changes to the
						app without knowing any coding or database skills.
					</p>

				</div>

					<figcaption> The app needed to accomodate resources grouped together in several layers of spreadsheets, as shown in this diagram.</figcaption>

			<div class="half-col">
				<div class="left">
					<p>
						Each category has translated titles in arabic and farsi, and an icon
						for users who don’t have any literacy skills. All pages and images
						are available offline after downloading over wifi. Each resource page
						provides users essential resource information including locations,
						contacts, languages offered and additional resources and documents.
						The resource information was filled in with the help of ISSofBC.
					</p>
					<p>
						I completed the first version of the app in April 2019.

			<p>
				While on extension for the co-op, I attempted to add requested features
				based on findings from a focus group with Home Visitors for a new version.
				Since time had passed, I was forced to upgrade to a newer version of React
				Native and Expo. This broke my code without any clear signs of a solution.
				Given the persisting difficulty developing with React Native and Expo and
				using Google Drive, I decided to head in a different direction.

			<h3>Web App</h3>
			<p>
				On my last extension in this position, I took a database course in addition
				to working part time. This helped me learn how to properly store and handle
				the information the RHH app needed. I chose to first make a website
				(using React.js) instead of an app to iterate and establish a data structure
				more quickly. I used Google Firebase as it allowed me to use their services
				for free and it interfaced well to both React and React Native. Using Google
				Firebase also gave me the opportunity to make an administrator interface
				for when the resource information needed changing, and allows me to have
				interactive elements (such as maps or videos).
			</p>
			<p>
				I also created wireframes to communicate my new
				direction to colleagues, and to guide me as I build the website.

			<p>
				One of the best things about React is that it is very easy to build
				websites and UI using atomic design. <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">
					Atomic design</a> is a concept developed
				by Brad Frost, where elements build upon each other to make modular
				designs that can be built further to create pages. I applied this
				philosophy as I coded and designed the RHH website. For example, a
				service page is made of several different dynamic modules (Service
				info, Locations, Contacts, Additional info) and within some of those
				modules there are also dynamic modules (maps, contact info).

				Building this website went much more smoothly than developing for a
				mobile app, and allowed me to work more quickly. It also helped me
				learn React.js, and ultimately improved my web design skills. (to be updated when website is complete)

			<h3>Learning Reflection</h3>
			<p>
				Through my time at Mothers Matter Centre I was able to learn and explore
				React and React Native, and perform user testing and focus groups in a
				professional environment. Learning new languages and libraries on my own
				gave me a worthy challenge for my computer programming and problem solving
				skills. This experience taught me persistence and how to find new ways
				to solve an issue. I am thankful for this opportunity with Mother Matter
				Centre. It is gratifying to know that my work directly assists RHH staff
				in improving the lives of RHH mothers.
