				<h3>Client</h3>
				<p>SFU Autistics United, Summer 2017, Individual</p>
				
				<div class="half-col">
					<div class="left">
						<h3>Objective</h3>
						<p> Create a logo that represented SFU Autistics United in a way that also connected the club to Canadian Autistics United (CAU).<p>
					</div>
					<div class="right">
						<h3>Tools</h3>
						<p>Adobe Illustrator, sketching.</p>

				In August 2017, my friend approached me to join their new club, SFU Autistics United. It’s a branch of a new organization, Canadian Autistics United (CAU). They promote the inclusion of autistic people in decisions that affect them, advocate for their needs, and make connections within autistic and disability communities. I was excited to join, and I was eager to help and offered my skills to create the logo.

			<h3>Design Considerations</h3>
			
			
				<p>
					I had to be mindful of how the club would be represented. In the autism community, there is conversation around the negative connotations of using the puzzle piece to represent autism. One solution is the infinity symbol, which has a more positive and accepting meaning. SFU Autistics United wanted to focus on this symbol for its connotations and to be better associated with CAU and their concept logo.

				<figure class="left">
					<img src="../img/sfuau/puzzle-piece.svg" alt="a line drawing of a corner puzzle piece at a 45 degree angle" class="smaller">
					<figcaption>The puzzle piece has been a common symbol for autism advocacy, but it suggests that autism is a puzzle that must be solved. This is often hurtful and alienating for autistic people.
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<figure>
					<img src="../img/sfuau/infinity.svg" class="smaller" alt="a line drawing of an infinity loop that's rainbow colored.">
					<figcaption> The infinity loop with a rainbow gradient is a more positive symbol with its association with the Neurodiversity movement, which promotes accepting differences like autism.

			<h3>Sketching and Choosing a Design</h3>
			<p>
				In my sketching, I explored different ways to incorporate the infinity symbol. It was important that the club believed the logo represented them, so I had them vote on the design. 
			</p>
			<figure class="multi">
				<div class="third-col">
					<div class="left">
						<img src="../img/sfuau/infinity-1.jpg" alt="a sketch of 6 infinity-loops colored in rainbow-order, stacked slightly on top of each other">
					</div>
					<div>
						<img src="../img/sfuau/infinity-2.jpg" alt="a sketch of 6 infinity-loops colored in rainbow order looping through each other side-by-side">
					</div>
					<div class="right">
						<img src="../img/sfuau/infinity-3.jpg" alt="a sketch of 3 infinity loops, each with 2 colors of the rainbow, looping through each other at the bottom, with the side loops pointed at an angle">
					</div>
				</div>
				<figcaption>
					These sketches were more popular because they focused more on the autism identity of the club.

					<div class="right">
						<img src="../img/sfuau/shield-2.jpg" alt="a sketch of a shield with 3 connected infinity loops on it">
					</div>
				</div>
				<figcaption>
					Some less popular sketches, since it focused more on the SFU identity than the autism identity.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			
			<div class="half-col">
				<p class="left">
					The chosen sketch was very similar to the CAU sketch provided to me. However, having the loops connect created a greater sense of unity.

				<div class="right">

			<h3>Digital Creation</h3>
			<p>
				Next was to create a digital copy, I chose a more visually sound rainbow palette, as opposed to an overwhelming neon or intense rainbow. The club founder suggested that I use the curved text from a previous sketch. After voting on the font, the SFU Autistics United logo was born!
			</p>
			<div class="center">
				<img src="../img/sfuau/final.jpg" alt="a digital version of the rough sketch, with 'SFU Autisitics United' wrapping around the bottom of the loop-circle">

			<h3>Result</h3>
			<div class="half-col">
				<p class="left">
					The logo was very well received. So much that CAU also wanted to use it. It's currently on their facebook page for national and local divisions.

				Today, I'm still involved in the club, helping with other materials that need graphic design. I'm proud of the work I’ve done and I can’t wait to do more!
