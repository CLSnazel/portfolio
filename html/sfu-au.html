			<h2>Logo Design</h2>
			
			<p>
				In August 2017, my friend approached me to join their new club, SFU Autistics United. It’s a branch of a new organization, Canadian Autistics United (CAU). They promote the inclusion of autistic people in decisions that affect them, advocate for their needs, and make connections within autistic and disability communities. I was excited to join, and I was eager to help and offered my skills to create the logo.

			<h3>Design Considerations</h3>
			
			<p>
				I had to be mindful of how the club would be represented. In the autism community, there is conversation around the negative connotations of using the puzzle piece to represent autism. One solution is the infinity symbol, which has a more positive and accepting meaning. SFU Autistics United wanted to focus on this symbol for its connotations and to be better associated with CAU and their concept logo.

				<figure>
					<img src="../img/sfuau/puzzle piece.svg" class="smaller">
					<figcaption>While the puzzle piece has been a symbol for autism advocacy for a long time, as a symbol it suggests that autism is a puzzle that must be solved. Which is often hurtful and alienating for autistic people.
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<figure>
					<img src="../img/sfuau/infinity.svg" class="smaller">
					<figcaption> The infinity loop in combination with a rainbow gradient is a more positive symbol, one reason being with its association with the Neurodiversity movement, which promotes accepting differences like autism.

			<h3>Creating the Logo</h3>
			<p>
				In my sketching, I explored different ways to incorporate the infinity symbol. It was important that the club believed the logo represented them, so I had them vote on the design. The logo sketch they chose was very similar to the CAU sketch provided to me. However, having the loops connect created a greater sense of unity. 
			</p>

				<div class="quarter-col">
					<img src="../img/sfuau/infinity-1.jpg">
					<img src="../img/sfuau/infinity-2.jpg">
					<img src="../img/sfuau/infinity-3.jpg">
				</div>
				<figcaption>
					These sketches were more popular because they focused more on the autism part of the club, rather than the club being an SFU club. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				While creating the logo digitally, I choose a rainbow palette that was more visually sound as opposed to an overwhelming neon or intense rainbow. The club founder suggested that I use the curved text from a previous sketch. After voting on the font, the SFU Autistics United logo was born!
			</p>

			<h3>Result</h3>
			<p>
				The logo was very well received. So much that CAU is also using it on their national facebook page and for local divisions. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Today, I am still involved in the club, helping with other materials that need graphic design. I am proud of the work I’ve done and I can’t wait to do more!
