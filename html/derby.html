						For this project, my team and I chose roller derby as our user group. We picked roller derby because it’s one of the fastest growing sports, and was considered for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. The majority of athletes are women, and is inclusive to non-binary individuals. I’ve also been involved in roller derby since 2013, and had access to the community to gather research.

			<h3>The Problem</h3>
			<p>After attending a beginners practice together, we decided to focus on planning roller derby games, called bouts. Every derby league is non-profit, and is supported by volunteers. With resources like referees being scarce, planning a bout comes with the challenge of coordinating with other leagues to avoid scheduling conflicts. </p>
			<div class="half-col">
				<div class="left">
					<figure class="left">
					<img src="../img/derby/problem.jpg" alt="a presentation slide that says: The problem: run by volunteers. Roller Derby operates as non-profit organizations. As a result, they cannot pay their referees, announcers, organizers or coaches. Plus, equipment costs are upwards of $300 per player. Resources and venues are dwindling, and promotion for the sport is rare and costly. *based on ethnographic, on-track interviews with 11 users.">

			<h3>Visual Style</h3>
			<div class="half-col">
				<div class="left">
					<p>
						We wanted to reflect roller derby’s grassroots, punky and expressive values in our app’s visual style. This meant bold font and color combinations. However, at our first attempt, the designs looked like a prototype instead of completed app.
					</p>

					<img src="../img/derby/brandanalysis.jpg" alt="a presentation slide with a two axis layout. Going up is expressive, going down is underground, going left is supportive, going right is devoted">

			<h3>Sketches and Improvements</h3>
			<p>While adjusting our visual layout, some of my new sketches were used to build a new design. For the venue selector, I was inspired by Google Maps and how they organized information for a location. When users select a venue on the map, they get the ability to book or review venue details, then move on to select teams.</p>
			
			<p>For the event summary, our issue was that the page looked like an invoice. Our teaching assistant suggested that we examine Google’s method of organizing information into cards. I applied this idea to our summary page in sketching, chunking it into 3 sections.</p>
			
			<p>Another improvement I made was for a roller skate wheel that spins as the app loads. While user testing, most users recognized it as a orange slice, and not a skate wheel. To refine this, I used multiple layers of circles to give the wheel depth without having to warp the shape. After setting each layer to spin together, the result was a very intriguing 3D-look.</p>

			<h3>Learning</h3>
			<p>Throughout this project and the course, it was a good experience learning how to design apps. When I started the course, I was making very blocky and rigid designs, and as the course progressed I learned how to take more advantage of scrolling and give more breathing room. I was also happy to be able to do research and applying it to create a design solution. It was also a good experience to discuss roller derby with my fellow skaters and understanding their thoughts about the sport.</p>
