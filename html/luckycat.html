				<h3>Class</h3>
				<p>Materials in Design, Spring 2017, Team of 2</p>
				
				<div class="half-col">

						<h3>Objective</h3>
						<p> Dissect a found object and create a poster of exploded view of how the found object assembles, in order to understand the importance of the choice and quality of material.<p>
					</div>
					<div class="right">
						<h3>Tools</h3>
						<p>Adobe Illustrator and a camera</p>

						For this project my partner and I used a waving lucky cat figurine I bought that stopped working.  During our lab we took apart, and even damaged the lucky cat in order to get it open and see how it worked. It functioned via a small solar power bar that powered an electromagnet that moved a pendulum containing magnets, causing the arm to move.
					</p>
					<p>
						My role was to capture images of each part of the object and use them to recreate them in Illustrator to construct a diagram of how each part fit together.

			<h3> Inspiration and Process</h3>
			
			<div class="third-col">
				<p class="left">
					Growing up, I was always interested in how things fit together. I would often take things apart and make my own diagrams of my own creations and how they fit together. I also greatly enjoyed following assembly instructions from Ikea and Lego.

			<div class="half-col">
				<p class="left">
					From this small passion, I was inspired to take the time to a more polished look to the diagram To do this, I captured photos of the parts and deformed them to fit an isometric view. Instead of using the photos as part of the diagram, I decided that making outlines of each part would give a cleaner look, inspired by the Ikea assembly style. I made sure to include concealed details in dotted lines, and using dashed lines for the alignment of the parts.

				</figure>
				<p class="right">
					Once the drawing portion was complete, I passed my work on to my partner, where he labeled each part with numbers, and added our evaluation of the object. The amount of detail and sophistication in the drawing and analysis was appreciated by our instructors and we received high marks.
