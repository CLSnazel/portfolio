					<h3>The Client </h3>
					<p>USRS is a non-profit that rescues invasive animals, often forfeited exotic pets. During our project, they were at capacity, caring for over 400 animals. They rely on dedicated volunteers to maintain the organization. </p>
					<p>Our team researched the volunteering and the training process. We designed a system with volunteer name tags, a redesigned daily checklist, and instructions for volunteers to use as they work. I created digital renderings of the name tags and instructions to convey our concepts to teaching staff.</p>

			<h3>Volunteer Instructions</h3>
			<div class="half-col">
				<div class="left">
					<p>We targeted instructions because volunteers struggled with remembering instructions, they had to work independently, and staff were unavailable to answer questions. Signage for each animal provided information to visitors. We recreated the existing signs to expand, so volunteers can access instructions.</p>

To the right of the door, there is a long piece of paper with animal information at the top, and instructions below. The instructions fold up behind the top portion ">
					<figcaption> A digital render I created of the intial design concept, where each animal sign expands to show instructions for volunteers.</figcaption>
				</figure>
			</div>
			<div class="half-col">
				<div class="left">
					<p>This initial design wasn’t easily manipulated or removable. To improve it, we made a case that holds portable task cards for volunteers, with the front listing the animal’s information. These were laminated to protect them in the animal care environment.</p>
				</div>
				<figure class="right">
					<img src="../img/research/finalsignage.jpg" alt="A photo of a small animal tank, with rocks inside, sitting on a white table. On it's face sits a case, with the animals information sitting on the front. On the table below the tank sits two cards, each detailing instructions for two different for that animals' care.">

			<h3>Name Tags</h3>
			<div class="half-col">
				<div class="left">
					<p>We designed the nametags as part of a volunteer skill advancement system in the renewed checklist.  Volunteers didn’t always know their boundaries at USRS, and in past cases, volunteers overreached their abilities and put animals at risk. Name tags would also show who else they can ask for help. Each personal name tag had a star rating, with stickers added as the volunteer progressed.</p>
				</div>
				<figure class="right">
					<img src="../img/research/nametag.jpg" alt="a photo of a woman's torso, wearing a grey tshirt with the USRS logo on the top corner on her left. Above the logo, sits a nametag with her name and her star rating.">
					<figcaption> A digital render I created of the first name tag design. As volunteers progressed in their abilities at USRS, stickers would be added on top of the nametag. </figcaption>
				</figure>
			</div>
			<div class="half-col">
				<div class="left">
					<p>However, each personal name tag would cost materials, and displaying a volunteer’s name could break their personal privacy. Star ratings also wasn’t true to USRS’s branding. Together we chose new volunteer skill titles like “Apprentice Aardvark”, and redesigned it to fit with the client's brand.</p>
				</div>

					<img src="../img/research/finalnametag.jpg" alt="A nametag sitting on a grey background from a bird's-eye view. The nametag has the USRS logo, the word volunteer, an illustration of a red parrot, and the title 'Master Macaw: ask me anything'.">

			<h3>Final Showcase</h3>
			<p>For the showcase, I created display card that explained what each artifact was meant to do, the research that supports the need for it, and how the research influenced our design decisions.</p>

			<p>We tied for first place at the showcase based on audience voting. We were unique for using a physical medium, we were very grounded in our research, and made a practical solution for the client.</p>

			<h3>Learning Reflection</h3>
			<p>While this class taught me a lot about user research, the hands on experience of working with a client showed me the amount of care and attention user research requires. Through our studies, we witnessed a power-dynamic issue where having staff and volunteers in the same room with us may have discouraged the volunteers from speaking up about their thoughts and ideas. It was also valuable for me to create designs that were directly related to the research we did, and be able provide evidence for our design reasoning.</p>
