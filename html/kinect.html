			<h2>Augmented Reality Sandbox</h2>
			<div class="overview">
				<h3>Class</h3>
				<p>Introduction to Technology, Summer 2015, Team of 4</p>
				
				<div class="half-col">
					<div class="left">
						<h3>Objective</h3>
						<p>Create an interactive technological system within an applicabile stream (Health, Education, Robotics, Interactive Sculpture, etc.).<p>
					</div>
					<div class="right">
						<h3>Tools</h3>
						<p>Microsoft Kinect, Arduino Uno, <a href="https://processing.org">Processing IDE</a></p>

					For this project our team was inspired by UC Davis and their Augmented Reality (AR) Sandbox, a sandbox that projected an elevation map of the sand, and reflected changes in real-time. We wanted recreate this concept, and build upon it with fish that would swim in the water of the elevation map.

				As primary coder, I programmed a large majority of the project. I also helped lead the group throughout the term, organizing meetings, and asking for help with other tasks.

					Our team started immediately, and began with testing with the Kinect. We were able to add color to specific depth levels, and captured an image of our progress.

			<h3>A Sudden Halt</h3>
			<div class="half-col">
				<p class="left">
					At the following meeting, the program stopped working. The code wasn’t modified, and it ran perfectly before. The project went to a halt. I tried the program on different computers, reinstalling the appropriate drivers, back tracked to previous versions, and reached out to forums online. 
				</p>

			<p>
				 I found out that the Kinect’s Infrared Sensor was not turning on, even when plugged in. Based on my research, I determined that we needed a new power supply. After testing with a new cord, the program ran successfully and we finally moved forward.

			<h3>Creating the Fish and the Rig</h3>
			<p>
				For the fish, we needed to be able to add, select, remove, and change the fish’s color using the Arduino Uno and sensors. I asked my team members to program the foundation of the arduino portion, while I programmed the fish. Once we built the rig that held everything together, our project was complete.

			<h3>Results</h3>
			<p>
				We presented our project to our instructors, receiving perfect marks. It was also showcased at the SFU Surrey Open House in March of 2016. Some improvements I would make would be a more sturdy rig, use kinetic sand, polish its appearance and replace the touch sensors with push-buttons.
